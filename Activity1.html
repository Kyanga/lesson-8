            <p>Butterflies are very good fliers. They have two pairs of large wings covered with colorful, iridescent scales in
            overlapping rows. Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) are the only insects that have scaly wings. The wings are attached
            to the butterflyâ€™s thorax (mid-section). Veins support the delicate wings and nourish them with blood.
            
            Butterflies can only fly if their body temperature is above 86 degrees. Butterflies sun themselves to warm up in cool
            weather. As butterflies age, the color of the wings fades and the wings become ragged.
            
            The speed varies among butterfly species (the poisonous varieties are slower than non-poisonous varieties). The fastest
            butterflies (some skippers) can fly at about 30 mile per hour or faster. Slow flying butterflies fly about 5 mphButterflies and moths undergo complete metamorphosis in which they go through four different life stages.
            
            Egg - A butterfly starts its life as an egg, often laid on a leaf.
            Larva - The larva (caterpillar) hatches from an egg and eats leaves or flowers almost constantly. The caterpillar molts
            (loses its old skin) many times as it grows. The caterpillar will increase up to several thousand times in size before
            pupating.
            Pupa - It turns into a pupa (chrysalis); this is a resting stage.
            Adult - A beautiful, flying adult emerges. This adult will continue the cycle..</p>
