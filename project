            <p>lion, (Panthera leo), large, powerfully built cat (family Felidae) that is second in size only to the tiger; it is a
            famous apex predator (meaning without a natural predator or enemy). The proverbial “king of beasts,” the lion has been
            one of the best-known wild animals since earliest times. Lions are most active at night and live in a variety of
            habitats but prefer grassland, savanna, dense scrub, and open woodland. Historically, they ranged across much of Europe,
            Asia, and Africa, but now they are found mainly in parts of Africa south of the Sahara. An isolated population of about
            between 500 and 700 wild Asiatic lions constitute a slightly smaller population that lives under strict protection in
            India’s Gir National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary.

            The lion is a well-muscled cat with a long body, large head, and short legs. Size and appearance vary considerably
            between the sexes. The male’s outstanding characteristic is his mane, which varies between different individuals and
            populations. It may be entirely lacking; it may fringe the face; or it may be full and shaggy, covering the back of the
            head, neck, and shoulders and continuing onto the throat and chest to join a fringe along the belly. In some lions the
            mane and fringe are very dark, almost black, giving the cat a majestic appearance. Manes make males look larger and may
            serve to intimidate rivals or impress prospective mates. A full-grown male is about 1.8–2.1 metres (6–7 feet) long,
            excluding the 1-metre tail; he stands about 1.2 metres high at the shoulder and weighs 170–230 kg (370–500 pounds). The
            female, or lioness, is smaller, with a body length of 1.5 metres, a shoulder height of 0.9–1.1 metres, and a weight of
            120–180 kg. The lion’s coat is short and varies in colour from buff yellow, orange-brown, or silvery gray to dark brown,
            with a tuft on the tail tip that is usually darker than the rest of the coat.

            Lions are unique among cats in that they live in a group, or pride. The members of a pride typically spend the day in
            several scattered groups that may unite to hunt or share a meal. A pride consists of several generations of lionesses,
            some of which are related, a smaller number of breeding males, and their cubs. The group may consist of as few as 4 or
            as many as 37 members, but about 15 is the average size. Each pride has a well-defined territory consisting of a core
            area that is strictly defended against intruding lions and a fringe area where some overlap is tolerated. Where prey is
            abundant, a territory area may be as small as 20 square km (8 square miles), but if game is sparse, it may cover up to
            400 square km. Some prides have been known to use the same territory for decades, passing the area on between females.
            Lions proclaim their territory by roaring and by scent marking. Their distinctive roar is generally delivered in the
            evening before a night’s hunting and again before getting up at dawn. Males also proclaim their presence by urinating on
            bushes, trees, or simply on the ground, leaving a pungent scent behind. Defecation and rubbing against bushes leave
            different scent markings.
            
            There are a number of competing evolutionary explanations for why lions form groups. Large body size and high density of
            their main prey probably make group life more efficient for females in terms of energy expenditure. Groups of females,
            for example, hunt more effectively and are better able to defend cubs against infanticidal males and their hunting
            territory against other females. The relative importance of these factors is debated, and it is not clear which was
            responsible for the establishment of group life and which are secondary benefits.</p></h4>
